# cssa-server-icons
This is a repo to hold the icons for the ANU CSSA discord server, feel free to add to it.
The repo name is `cssa-pride-icons` because this was originally a project for pride month, but now all icons go into here so it's really just `cssa-server-icons`.
I haven't changed the repo name though because I'm pretty sure the bot powering the server icon will detonate itself if I change the repo name, and deploying new versions of it is a pain.
